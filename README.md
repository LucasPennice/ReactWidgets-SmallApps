This repository is a mix of projects from Traversy Media's Udemy course (https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/) "50 Projects In 50 Days - HTML, CSS & JavaScript" and Stephen Grider's (https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux/) Udemy Course "Modern React with Redux"

The first 7 projects (except the Wikipedia Search Article) are simple widgets are ment to be reused in future/larger projects.
The Translator, Youtube search App and Wikipedia Search Article are little projects made to sharpen my function based component and hooks skills. Besides it was really helpful to have to go thru so much API documentation and testing (I used Postman for that).
